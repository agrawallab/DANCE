**DANCE** (Drosophila Aggression and Courtship Evaluator), provides an accessible, affordable, and robust solution for quantifying aggression and courtship behaviors in Drosophila. The DANCE hardware is ~10,000X cheaper and has comparable performance to existing traditional set ups. 

**Key Features:**

•	Six machine learning-based classifiers: Developed using JAABA, these classifiers excel at quantifying aggressive lunges and five courtship behaviors—wing extension, circling, following, attempted copulation and copulation.

•	Ultra-low-cost, portable hardware: Fabricated using off-the-shelf, repurposed materials like medicine blister packs, acrylic sheets and paper tape, with recordings done via smartphones and tablets/smartphone used as backlight source.

•	Open-source pipeline: Designed to be user-friendly and accessible to conduct sophisticated behavioral analysis.
